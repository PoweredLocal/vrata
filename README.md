API gateway implemented in PHP and Lumen. Currently only supports JSON format.

## Preface

API gateway is an important component of microservices architectural pattern – it's a layer that sits in front of all your services. [Read more](http://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html)

## Overview

Vrata (Russian for 'gates') is a simple API gateway implemented in PHP7 with Lumen framework

Introductory blog post [in English](https://medium.com/@poweredlocal/developing-a-simple-api-gateway-in-php-and-lumen-f84756cce043#.6yd9uwmat), [in Russian](https://habrahabr.ru/post/315128/)

## Requirements and dependencies

- PHP >= 7.0
- Lumen 5.3
- Guzzle 6
- Laravel Passport (with [Lumen Passport](https://github.com/dusterio/lumen-passport))
- Memcached (for request throttling)

## Running as a Docker container

Ideally, you want to run this as a stateless Docker container configured entirely by environment variables. Therefore, you don't even need to deploy
this code anywhere yourself - just use our [public Docker Hub image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pwred/vrata).

Deploying it is as easy as:

```bash
$ docker run -d -e GATEWAY_SERVICES=... -e GATEWAY_GLOBAL=... -e GATEWAY_ROUTES=... pwred/vrata
```

Where environment variables are JSON encoded settings (see configuration options below).

## Configuration via environment variables

Ideally you won't need to touch any code at all. You could just snap the latest Docker image, set environment variables and done. API gateway is not a place to hold any business logic, API gateway is a smart proxy that can discover microservices, query them and process their responses with minimal adjustments.

### Terminology and structure

Internal structure of a typical API gateway - microservices setup is as follows:

![API gateway - structure](https://www.mysenko.com/images/vrata-internal_map.jpg)

Since API gateway doesn't have any state really it scales horizontally very well.

### Lumen variables

#### CACHE_DRIVER

It's recommended to set this to 'memcached' or another shared cache supported by Lumen if you are running multiple instances of API gateway. API rate limitting relies on cache.

#### DB_DATABASE, DB_HOST, DB_PASSWORD, DB_USERNAME, DB_CONNECTION

Standard Lumen variables for your database credentials. Use if you keep users in database.
See Laravel/Lumen documentation for the list of supported databases.

#### APP_KEY

Lumen application key

### Gateway variables

#### PRIVATE_KEY

Put your private RSA key in this variable

You can generate the key with OpenSSL:

```bash
$ openssl genrsa -out private.key 4096
```

Replace new line characters with \n:
```bash
awk 1 ORS='\\n' private.key
```

#### PUBLIC_KEY

Put your public RSA key in this variable

Extract public key using OpenSSL:
```bash
$ openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout > public.key
```

Replace new line characters with \n:
```bash
awk 1 ORS='\\n' public.key
```

#### GATEWAY_SERVICES

JSON array of microservices behind the API gateway

#### GATEWAY_ROUTES

JSON array of extra routes including any aggregate routes

#### GATEWAY_GLOBAL

JSON object with global settings

#### X_HEADER_WHITELIST

JSON object with custom headers that will be forwarded to the microservices

### Logging

Currently only LogEntries is supported out of the box. To send nginx and Lumen logs to LE, simply set two
environmetn variables:

#### LOGGING_ID

Identification string for this app

#### LOGGING_LOGENTRIES

Your user key with LogEntries

## Features

- Built-in OAuth2 server to handle authentication for all incoming requests
- Aggregate queries (combine output from 2+ APIs)
- Output restructuring
- Aggregate Swagger documentation (combine Swagger docs from underlying services) *
- Automatic mount of routes based on Swagger JSON
- Sync and async outgoing requests
- DNS service discovery

## Installation

You can either do a git clone or use composer (Packagist):

```bash
$ composer create-project poweredlocal/vrata
```

## Features

### Auto-import of Swagger-compliant endpoints

You can define URL(s) of Swagger documentation endpoints - a default URL and custom per-service URLs if necessary.
Imagine you have a Symfony2 microservice with Nelmio ApiDoc plugin running on `/api/doc`. Your microservice
returns something like:

```bash
$ curl -v http://localhost:8000/api/doc
{
	"swaggerVersion": "1.2",
	"apis": [{
		"path": "\/uploads",
		"description": "Operations on file uploads."
	}],
	"apiVersion": "0.1",
	"info": {
		"title": "Symfony2",
		"description": "My awesome Symfony2 app!"
	},
	"authorizations": []
}

$ curl -v http://localhost:8000/api/doc/uploads
{
	"swaggerVersion": "1.2",
	"apiVersion": "0.1",
	"basePath": "\/api",
	"resourcePath": "\/uploads",
	"apis": [{
		"path": "\/uploads",
		"operations": [{
			"method": "GET",
			"summary": "Retrieve list of files",
			"nickname": "get_uploads",
			"parameters": [],
			"responseMessages": [{
				"code": 200,
				"message": "Returned when successful",
				"responseModel": "AppBundle.Entity.Upload[items]"
			}, {
				"code": 500,
				"message": "Authorization error or any other problem"
			}],
			"type": "AppBundle.Entity.Upload[items]"
		}
	},
	"produces": [],
	"consumes": [],
	"authorizations": []
}
```

This endpoint may be auto-imported to API gateway during container start (or whenever you see it fit).

Assuming this microservice is listed in *GATEWAY_SERVICES*, we can now run auto-import:

```bash
$ php artisan gateway:parse
** Parsing service1
Processing API action: http://localhost:8000/uploads
Dumping route data to JSON file
Finished!
```

That's it - Vrata will now "proxy" all requests for `/uploads` to this microservice.

### OAuth2 authentication

Vrata ships with Laravel Passport - a fully featured OAuth2 server. JSON Web Tokens are used to authenticate all
API requests, and currently only local persistence (database) is supported. However, it's trivial
to move OAuth2 server outside and rely on JWT token verification using public keys.

If incoming bearer token is invalid, Vrata will return 401 Non Authorized error. If the token is valid,
Vrata will add two extra headers when making requests to underlying microservices:

*X-User*

Numeric subject Id extracted from the JSON Web Token. Your microservices can always assume the authentication
part is done already and trust this user Id. If you want to implement authorization, you may base it on
this Id or on token scopes (see below).

*X-Token-Scopes*

Token scopes extracted from the JSON web token. Comma separated (eg. ```read,write```)

Your microservice may use these for authorization purposes (restrict certain actions, etc).

*X-Client-Ip*

Original user IP address.

### Basic output mutation

You can do basic JSON output mutation using ```output``` property of an action. Eg.
```php
[
    'service' => 'service1',
    'method' => 'GET',
    'path' => '/pages/{page}',
    'sequence' => 0,
    'output_key' => 'data'
];
```

Response from *service1* will be included in the final output under *data* key.

```output_key``` can be an array to allow further mutation:
```php
[
    'service' => 'service1',
    'method' => 'GET',
    'path' => '/pages/{page}',
    'sequence' => 0,
    'output_key' => [
        'id' => 'service_id',
        'title' => 'service_title',
        '*' => 'service_more'
    ]
];
```

This will assign contents of *id* property to *garbage_id*, *title* to *service_title*
and the rest of the content will be inside of *service_more* property of the output JSON.

## Performance

Performance is one of the key indicators of an API gateway and that's why we chose Lumen – bootstrap only takes ~25ms on a basic machine.

See an example of an aggregate request. First let's do separate requests to underlying microservices:

```bash
$ time curl http://service1.local/devices/5
{"id":5,"network_id":2,...}
real    0m0.025s

$ time curl http://service1.local/networks/2
{"id":2,...}
real    0m0.025s

$ time curl http://service2.local/visits/2
[{"id":1,...},{...}]
real    0m0.041s
```

So that's 91ms of real OS time – including all the web-server-related overhead. Let's now make a single aggregate request to the API gateway
which behind the scenes will make the same 3 requests:

```bash
$ time curl http://gateway.local/devices/5/details
{"data":{"device":{...},"network":{"settings":{...},"visits":[]}}}
real    0m0.056s
```

And it's just 56ms for all 3 requests! Second and third requests were executed in parallel (in async mode).

This is pretty decent, we think!

## Examples

### Example 1: Single, simple microservice

Let's say we have a very simple setup: API Gateway + one microservice behind it.

First, we need to let the gateway know about this microservice by adding it to GATEWAY_SERVICES environment variable.

```json
{
	"service": []
}
```

Where *service* is the nickname we chose for our microservice. The array is empty because we will rely on default settings.
Our service has a valid Swagger documentation endpoint running on ```api/doc``` URL.

Next, we provide global settings on GATEWAY_GLOBAL environment variable:

```json
{
	"prefix": "/v1",
	"timeout": 3.0,
	"doc_point": "/api/doc",
	"domain": "supercompany.io"
}
```

This tells the gateway that services that don't have explicit URLs provided, will be communicated at
{serviceId}.{domain}, therefore our service will be contacted at service.supercompany.io, request timeout will be 3 seconds,
Swagger documentation will be loaded from ```/api/doc``` and all routes will be prefixed with "v1".

We could however specify service's hostname explicitly using "hostname" key in the GATEWAY_SERVICES array.

Now we can run ```php artisan gateway:parse``` to force Vrata to parse Swagger documentation
provided by this service. All documented routes will be exposed in this API gateway.

If you use our Docker image, this command will be executed every time you start a container.

Now, if your service had a route ```GET http://service.supercompany.io/users```, it will be available as
```GET http://api-gateway.supercompany.io/v1/users``` and all requests will be subject to JSON Web Token check and rate limiting.

Don't forget to set PRIVATE_KEY and PUBLIC_KEY environment variables, they are necessary for authentication to work.

### Example 2: Multiple microservices with aggregate requests

This time we are going to add two services behind our API gateway - one with Swagger 1 documentation and another
with Swagger 2 documentation. Vrata detects Swagger version automatically, so we don't have to specify this
anywhere. Let's first define **GATEWAY_SERVICES** environment variable:

```json
{
	"core": [],
	"service1": []
}
```

So we have two services - "core" and "service1", Vrata will assume that DNS hostnames will match these.

Let's define **GATEWAY_GLOBAL** variable now - this variable contains global settings of the API gateway:

```json
{
	"prefix": "/v1",
	"timeout": 10.0,
	"doc_point": "/api/doc",
	"domain": "live.vrata.io"
}
```

All routes imported from Swagger will be prefixed with "/v1" because of the first setting. 10 seconds is the timeout
we give our API gateway for internal requests to microservices behind it. "doc_point" is the URI of Swagger
documentation, and "domain" is the DNS domain that will be added to every service name.

Therefore, when Vrata tries to load Swagger documentation for "core" service, it will hit *http://core.live.vrata.io/api/doc* URL.
If you have unique Swagger URIs per microservice - you can define "doc_point" for every service individually.

Setting these two variables is enough to start working with Vrata - it will import all routes from "core" and "service1"
and start proxying requests to them.

However, if we need something more sophisticated - eg. an aggregated request that involves multiple
microservices at the same time, we need to define a third environment variable - **GATEWAY_ROUTES**.

Consider this example:

```json
[{
	"aggregate": true,
	"method": "GET",
	"path": "/v1/connections/{id}",
	"actions": {
		"venue": {
			"service": "core",
			"method": "GET",
			"path": "venues/{id}",
			"sequence": 0,
			"critical": true,
			"output_key": "venue"
		},
		"connections": {
			"service": "service1",
			"method": "GET",
			"path": "connections/{venue%data.id}",
			"sequence": 1,
			"critical": false,
			"output_key": {
				"data": "venue.clients"
			}
		},
		"access-lists": {
			"service": "service1",
			"method": "GET",
			"path": "/metadata/{venue%data.id}",
			"sequence": 1,
			"critical": false,
			"output_key": {
				"data": "venue.metadata"
			}
		}
	}
}, {
	"method": "GET",
	"path": "/v1/about",
	"public": true,
	"actions": [{
		"service": "service1",
		"method": "GET",
		"path": "static/about",
		"sequence": 0,
		"critical": true
	}]
}, {
	"method": "GET",
	"path": "/v1/history",
	"raw": true,
	"actions": [{
		"method": "GET",
		"service": "core",
		"path": "/connections/history"
	}]
}]
```

The config above defines 3 routes - two regular requests with custom settings and one aggregate request. Let's start
with simple requests:

```json
{
	"method": "GET",
	"path": "/v1/about",
	"public": true,
	"actions": [{
		"service": "service1",
		"method": "GET",
		"path": "static/about",
		"sequence": 0,
		"critical": true
	}]
}
```

This definition will add a "/v1/about" route to the API gateway that will be public - it won't require
any access token at all, authentication will be bypassed. It will proxy request to http://service1.live.vrata.io/static/about and
pass back whatever was returned.

Another simple route:

```json
{
	"method": "GET",
	"path": "/v1/history",
	"raw": true,
	"actions": [{
		"method": "GET",
		"service": "core",
		"path": "/connections/history"
	}]
}
```

This will add a "/v1/history" endpoint that will request data from http://core.live.vrata.io/connections/history.
Notice the "raw" flag - this means Vrata won't do any JSON parsing at all (and therefore you won't be able to mutate
output as result). This is important for performance - PHP may choke if you json_decode() and then json_encode() a huge string
- arrays and objects are very memory expensive in PHP.

And finally our aggregate route:

```json
{
	"aggregate": true,
	"method": "GET",
	"path": "/v1/connections/{id}",
	"actions": {
		"venue": {
			"service": "core",
			"method": "GET",
			"path": "venues/{id}",
			"sequence": 0,
			"critical": true,
			"output_key": "venue"
		},
		"connections": {
			"service": "service1",
			"method": "GET",
			"path": "connections/{venue%data.id}",
			"sequence": 1,
			"critical": false,
			"output_key": {
				"data": "venue.clients"
			}
		},
		"access-lists": {
			"service": "service1",
			"method": "GET",
			"path": "/metadata/{venue%data.id}",
			"sequence": 1,
			"critical": false,
			"output_key": {
				"data": "venue.metadata"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

First property marks it as an aggregate route - that's self explanatory. The route will be mounted as
"/v1/connections/{id}" where "id" will be any string or number. Then, this route involves 3 requests
to microservices and two of them can be made in parallel - because they have the same sequence number of 1.

Vrata will first make a request to http://core.live.vrata.io/venues/{id} where {id} is the parameter from request.
This route action is marked as critical - therefore, if it fails the whole request is abandoned.
All output from this action will be presented in the final JSON output as "venue" property.

Then, two requests will be launched simultaneously - to http://service1.live.vrata.io/connections/{id}
and another to http://service1.live.vrata.io/metadata/{id}. This time, {id} is taken from the output of
the previous action. Vrata will collect all outputs from all requests and make them available to all
following requests.

Since these two requests always happen later than the first one (because of the sequence setting),
they can have access to its output. Notice {venue%data.id} in the paths - this refers to "venue" (name
of the previous action) and "id" property of "data" object ("data.id" in dot notation).

Both actions are set to non-critical - if they fail, user will still receive a response, but corresponding
fields will be empty.

We only take "data" JSON property from both responses and we inject it to the final response as
 "venue.clients" and "venue.metadata".

### Example 3: Multiple microservices with aggregate POST / PUT / DELETE requests

Initial body of your POST, PUT or DELETE request come with origin tag usable in your json. You can use in your actions an optionnal body parameters for each requests. You can use origin tag to use the body sent in your initial request. You can also use the response of each actions in the body param like in a GET aggregate request. 

```json
{
	"aggregate": true,
	"method": "PUT",
	"path": "/v1/unregister/sendaccess",
	"actions": {	
	  "contact": {
		"service": "contact",
		"method": "PUT",
		"path": "unregister/newsletter",
		"sequence": 0,
		"critical": true,
		"body": {
			"email": "{origin%email}"
		},
		"output_key": "register"
	  },
	  "template": {
		"service": "notice",
		"method": "POST",
		"path": "notice/email/generate",
		"sequence": 1,
		"critical": true,
		"body": {
			"validationToken": "{contact%validationToken}",
			"noticeTypeId": "{contact%validationType}"
		},
		"output_key": "notice"
	  },
	  "check": {
		"service": "email",
		"method": "POST",
		"path": "email/send",
		"sequence": 2,
		"critical": true,
		"body": {
			"to": "{origin%email}",
			"sujet": "Email object",
			"queue_name": "urgent",
			"message_html": "{template%htmlTemplate}",
			"message_text": "text version",
			"from": "support@example.org",
			"nom": "Sender name"
		},
		"output_key": "result"
	  }
	}
}
```
